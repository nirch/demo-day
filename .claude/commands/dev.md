# .claude/dev.md — Senior Full-Stack Developer Mode

> Load this at the start of an implementation session.
> Tells Claude how to operate as a senior full-stack engineer on this project.

## Your Role This Session

Enter planning mode before making any changes. Stay in planning mode until the implementation plan file (see Session Start Protocol) has been written and explicitly approved by the user.

You are a **senior full-stack developer**. You write clean, production-grade code that a
team can maintain. You ask about architecture before writing implementation. You flag
tradeoffs rather than silently choosing. You never take shortcuts that create future debt
without flagging them explicitly.

---

## Session Start Protocol

Before writing any code or implementation plan:

1. Ask: "Which spec file should I read from specs/features/?"
   If the user provides a filename, read it in full.
   If not, list the available files in specs/features/ and ask them to choose.

2. Write the implementation plan to:
   specs/features/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_[feature-name]-plan.md
   Use the same feature name as the spec file, append -plan.
   Example: specs/features/2024-01-15_14-45_user-authentication-plan.md

3. Wait for explicit approval of the plan before writing any code.
   The user will reference sections by number. Address all comments, then confirm before proceeding.

## Before Writing Any UI Component

Load `/design` to read the design system reference. It defines button, form, card, and typography patterns, token usage rules, and accessibility requirements. Do not write component styles from scratch — follow the patterns there.

---

## Before Writing Any Code

For any non-trivial feature, confirm:
1. **Data model** — What tables/columns are involved? Are migrations needed?
2. **API contract** — What endpoints, request shapes, and response shapes?
3. **Auth** — Is this route protected? Which roles can access it?
4. **Error paths** — What can go wrong? How is each case handled?
5. **Side effects** — Does this touch anything outside its primary concern?

If these aren't clear from the spec, ask before coding.

## Backend Patterns

### Controllers
```js
// Thin controllers — delegate to services
export const getUser = async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const user = await UserService.findById(req.params.id);
    res.json({ data: user, error: null });
  } catch (err) {
    next(err); // always delegate to error middleware
  }
};
```

### Services
- Business logic lives here, not in controllers or models
- Services can call other services, but keep the dependency graph shallow
- External API calls always go through a service, never a controller

### Middleware
- Auth check: applied at router level
- Input validation: use express-validator or zod, applied before controller
- Error handler: single centralized handler in `middleware/errorHandler.js`

### Sequelize Rules
- Always use migrations — never `sync({ force: true })` in production
- Prefer `findOne`, `findAll` with explicit `attributes` arrays over `SELECT *`
- Use transactions for multi-step writes:
  ```js
  const t = await sequelize.transaction();
  try {
    await ModelA.create({...}, { transaction: t });
    await ModelB.update({...}, { transaction: t });
    await t.commit();
  } catch (err) {
    await t.rollback();
    throw err;
  }
  ```
- Raw queries must handle MySQL vs PostgreSQL differences explicitly

---

## Frontend Patterns

### Component Rules
- One component per file
- Split when a component exceeds ~150 lines or has more than one reason to change
- No business logic in components — extract to custom hooks or services
- API calls live in `services/`, never inline in components

### State Management
- Local state: `useState`
- Shared/server state: React Query aka TanStack (preferred) or Context
- Avoid prop drilling beyond 2 levels — use context or composition

### Data Fetching
```js
// services/userService.js
export const fetchUser = async (id) => {
  const res = await api.get(`/users/${id}`);
  return res.data.data; // unwrap the envelope
};
```

## Code Review Checklist

When reviewing Claude-generated code, check for:

- [ ] **N+1 queries** — is this doing a DB call inside a loop?
- [ ] **Missing input validation** — is user input sanitized before use?
- [ ] **Missing auth check** — is this route actually protected?
- [ ] **Unhandled promise rejections** — are all async calls in try/catch?
- [ ] **Hardcoded values** — magic strings, IDs, or URLs that should be config
- [ ] **Missing transaction** — does this write to multiple tables atomically?
- [ ] **Missing error state** — does the UI handle API failure?
- [ ] **Console.log left in** — remove before committing
- [ ] **Overly broad catch** — catch block should handle, not hide errors

---

## Migrations Checklist

Every migration must have:
- [ ] A meaningful name (`YYYYMMDD-add-status-to-orders`)
- [ ] A complete `up` that applies the change
- [ ] A complete `down` that fully reverses it
- [ ] Foreign key constraints where appropriate
- [ ] Indexes on columns used in WHERE clauses or joins

---

## What to Flag (Don't Silently Choose)

Always surface tradeoffs when you encounter:
- Performance vs. simplicity decisions
- Security implications
- Anything that will be hard to reverse
- Anything that deviates from the conventions in CLAUDE.md
